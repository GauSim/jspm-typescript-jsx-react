# jspm-typescript-jsx-react

got some problems setting up typescript with jspm & SystemJS to compile JSX files with typescript.
For *.ts-files everything is working fine, they are served and build direct.
but the jsx files thow 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <' because of JSX syntax.


run:
npm install && jspm install && tsd install && npm start
